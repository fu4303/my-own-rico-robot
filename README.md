## Live Code - [Preview](https://muchirijane.github.io/100-days-website/)

## Description

This is a project I created as I learned JavaScript. I went through Mozilla's documentation about Web Speech API and to practice what I learned, I created this chatbot called Rico. The idea behind the project was to create a dev chatbot where users an ask questions on how to get started with web development. Rico can answer questions like where to learn html and css, where to learn react js or just vanilla JavaScript. As I time goes I will continue to work on it and improve it.

#### Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- SASS
